Hey GPT-4! I need to create a comprehensive Amazon product analysis system that works for ALL categories on Amazon.com. 

The system should:
1. Detect ANY product category automatically (electronics, books, clothing, home, kitchen, beauty, toys, sports, automotive, etc.)
2. Calculate impulse factors for ALL product types
3. Find relevant alternatives for ANY category
4. Show product images for alternatives
5. Provide proper analysis regardless of category

Current issues:
- Only works well for headphones, phones, laptops
- Many categories show no alternatives
- Impulse factors might not be calculated properly for all categories
- Need comprehensive category detection

What's the best approach to:
1. Create universal category detection that covers all Amazon categories?
2. Generate relevant alternatives for any product type?
3. Ensure impulse factor calculation works across all categories?
4. Make the analysis robust and meaningful for any Amazon product?

Please provide a comprehensive strategy for making this work universally.
